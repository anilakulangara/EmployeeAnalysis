# ABC Company Employee Dataset Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains analysis tasks based on employee data, aimed at providing insights into various aspects such as employee distribution, position categorization, salary expenditures, and the relationship between age and salary. The analysis is performed using Python, with appropriate visualizations created to present the findings.

## Analysis Tasks

1. **Employee Distribution Across Teams**
   - Determine the distribution of employees across each team and calculate the percentage split relative to the total number of employees.

2. **Segregation of Employees by Position**
   - Segregate employees based on their positions within the company.

3. **Predominant Age Group**
   - Identify the predominant age group among employees.

4. **Team and Position with Highest Salary Expenditure**
   - Discover which team and position have the highest salary expenditure.

5. **Correlation Between Age and Salary**
   - Investigate if thereâ€™s any correlation between age and salary, and represent it visually.
  
## Graphical Representations

For each of the above analysis tasks, visualizations have been created to represent the findings effectively. The following types of graphs are used:
- **Bar Chart**: For the distribution of employees across teams and positions.
- **Pie Chart**: For the predominant age group among employees.
- **Histogram**: For segregating employee by position.
- **Bar Chart**: For team and position salary expenditure.
- **Scatter Plot**: To investigate the correlation between age and salary.

## Tools and Libraries Used

- **Python** (for data analysis)
- **Pandas** (for data manipulation and analysis)
- **Matplotlib** (for data visualization)
- **Seaborn** (for statistical visualizations)
